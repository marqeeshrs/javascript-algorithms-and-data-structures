I don't think I am learning effectively by crashing all of the material. There
are certain material that I can recall easily, but that was with HTML and CSS.
Now, I'm learning JavaScript, the learning curve steepened to where I need to slowdown.
So, I'll be returning to the course study with a different mind set: I cannot rush learning, 
Not in the way I was attempting to do it.
